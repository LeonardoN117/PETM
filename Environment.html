    <p>The environment during this time caused many animals to change and adapt to a new way of iife.</p>
    <p>plant life during this time had become more savanna or tropical like where as much green as there was in this world, no one could eascape the heat  </p>
    <p>Tree leaves and plant leaves had changed and adapted to become more warm </p>
    <p>The ocean has changed its chemistry to where water had become unsustainable to support certain marine life animals. </p>

    <p>The way we got here isn't exactly known but we do know that a potential cause was the release of greenhouse gasses</p>
    <p>These gasses include </p>
    <ol>
        <li> methane </li>
        <li> sulfur </li>
        <li> carbon dioxide </li>
    </ol>
    <p>these gasses came from volcanoes erupting around the world </p>
    <img src="images/tempura.png" alt="Dinosaur" />
    <p>With those gasses the planets temperatures raised substantially and the ice caps did not exist during this time </p>
    <p>the record breaking heat during this time period caused a shift as to how plants look and absorb sunlight </p>
