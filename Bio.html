    <p>The biology of life during this time went through lots of challenges</p>
    <p>With dinosaurs no longer being a major player in the food chain and in the formation of the ecosystem, new animals were able to grow from the shadows and become the new dominant species of Earth</p>
    <h4>From reptiles to mammals</h4>
    <p> Mammals took over the vacuum that the dinosaurs had left in the food chain and "species dominance"</p>
    <p>This is the time where our current day animals like the horse and wolves had their ancestors establish themselves in our world</p>
    <img src="images/animal1.jpeg" alt="animal" />
    <p>The oceans as well had a multitude of species die off and some were as small as amoebas</p>

    <img src="images/amoeba 1.jpeg" alt="meebaa" />
    </div>
    <p>With these microscopic extinctions there had to be giant animal extinctions which included the dinosaurs</p>
    <p>With a vacuum in the food chain, mammals took full advantage to grow in size.</p>
    <p>That advantage would pay off as most of the animals of today can be traced back to these ancient animals</p>
    <div class="image-row">
    <img src="images/animal2.jpeg" alt="animal" />
    <img src="images/animals3.jpg" alt="animal" />
    <p>However there is a stark difference in the sizing of present animals and those alive during the PETM</p>
    <img src="horse.jpg" alt="horse"/>
    <p>The animals of today are bigger than those back then and why is that?</p>
    <p>That is due to a phenomena called insular dwarfism</p>
    <p>Majority if not all animals during this time had to shrink in size in order to compensate for having to now live in an extremely hot climate</p>
    <p>The smaller body allowed the dissipation of heat to be easier which is necessary if one want to live in a hot environment and survive</p>
