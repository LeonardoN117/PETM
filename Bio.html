    <p>The biology of life during this time went through lots of challenges</p>
    <p>With dinosaurs no longer being a major player in the food chain and in the formation of the ecosystem, new animals were able to grow from the shadows and become the new dominant species of Earth</p>
    <h4>From reptiles to mammals</h4>
    <p> Mammals took over the vacuum that the dinosaurs had left in the food chain and "species dominance"</p>
    <p>This is the time where our current day animals like the horse and wolves had their ancestors establish themselves in our world</p>
    <img src="images/animal1.jpeg" alt="animal" />
    <p>The oceans as well had a multitude of species die off and some were as small as amoebas</p>

    <img src="images/amoeba 1.jpeg" alt="meebaa" />
    </div>
    <p>With these microscopic extinctions there had to be giant animal extinctions which included the dinosaurs</p>
    <p>These allowed mammals to evolve into what they soon became today</p>
